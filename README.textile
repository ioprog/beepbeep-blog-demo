h1. The obligatory blog application written with BeepBeep

This code shows how to build a simple application with BeepBeep. It demonstrates a simple application flow and the use
of filters for authentication.

h2. Setup

For simplicity, I've included everything you need (except Erlang) to run the app.

# Download the code
# CD into the beebeep_blog_example directory
# run make 
# run ./start-server.sh
# point your browser to http://localhost:8000

Since BeepBeep generates the core code and structure for you, the only code I needed to write for this
app was:

# src/main_controller.erl  - The controller for displaying and creating posts
# src/login_controller.erl - The controller for handling login
# The templates for the app, located in the template directory
# Oh, and the simple blog_db, used to store blog entries in-memory
